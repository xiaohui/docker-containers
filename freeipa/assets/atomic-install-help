Configuring and running IPA server with atomic

On platforms with atomic command available, the container can be
configured with

    atomic install [ --name $THE_NAME ] freeipa-server \
	[ keywords for docker operation ] \
	[ ipa-server-install | ipa-replica-install ] \
	[ opts ]

The keywords for docker operations are:

    hostname $IPA_SERVER_HOSTNAME - docker run -h $IPA_SERVER_HOSTNAME
    net-host - docker run --net=host, also uses host's hostname
    publish - docker run -p 443:443 ... ; publish all ports of the IPA
              container on host's interfaces
    cap-add $CAPABILITY - docker run --cap-add=$CAPAABILITY

The container will use /var/lib/$THE_NAME to store the configuration
and data. It the gets started with

    atomic run [ --name $THE_NAME ] freeipa-server

Version 1.12 of atomic is needed.
